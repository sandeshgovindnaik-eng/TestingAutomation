          "content": ["Java is platform independent because Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any computer that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).",

            "You write Java code once.",

            "The compiler converts it to bytecode.",

            "The JVM on any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) can run that bytecode.",

            "So the same program runs anywhere without changing the code."

          "content":[
            "Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float, long, and double, and hence it is not a pure object-oriented language.",
            "Non-primitive data types are complex data types that are created from primitive types or by the programmer. Examples include arrays, which store multiple values of the same type; strings, which store a sequence of characters; classes and objects, which are user-defined types containing properties and methods; and collections like lists, sets, and maps, which can hold many items together.",
            "Non-primitive data is stored in heap memory, which is used for bigger and dynamic data, while the variable that points to this data is stored in stack memory. For example, when a string is created, the actual characters of the string are stored in the heap, and the stack stores a reference, which is the memory address pointing to the string object in the heap. Whenever the program accesses the string, it uses the reference on the stack to locate and manipulate the string object in the heap.",
            "The stack and heap are connected through these references, meaning the stack keeps track of where the objects in the heap are located. This allows the program to efficiently manage memory: the stack handles method calls and local variables, while the heap stores complex objects that can be shared or dynamically resized during runtime."

            "Stack memory in Java is used to store local variables and function calls. It is fast and organized in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) way.",
            "Heap memory in Java is used to store objects and non-primitive data like arrays and strings. It is bigger than stack memory and can grow dynamically.",
            "In stack memory, variables store actual values for primitives and references (memory addresses) for objects. In heap memory, the actual objects and their data are stored.",
            "Java uses stack memory for method execution and temporary variables, while it uses heap memory to store objects that can be accessed from anywhere in the program.",
